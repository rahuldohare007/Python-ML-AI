# 🏠 Day 18/100 — Linear Regression Project (House Prices)

## 📚 Overview
In this project, I worked on the **House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques** dataset from Kaggle.
The aim was to predict the sale price of houses using a **Linear Regression** model.

## 📚 What I Did
- Worked with **House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques** dataset from Kaggle
- Cleaned and preprocessed data (handled missing values, encoded categories)
- Selected top features using domain knowledge & correlation
- Trained and evaluated a Linear Regression model

## ⚙️ Key Steps
1. Load CSV dataset
2. Choose important features
3. Train/test split
4. Fit & evaluate model

## 💡 Key Takeaways
- Simple Linear Regression with selected features can achieve good performance
- Feature selection is as important as the model itself
- Kaggle datasets are great for both learning and competing
