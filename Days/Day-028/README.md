 

This project applies **Unsupervised Machine Learning (Clustering)** to segment customers into distinct groups based on purchasing behavior and demographic features. The goal is to help businesses target customers more effectively.

## Features
- Implemented **KMeans clustering** to group similar customers  
- Determined optimal cluster count using **Elbow method**  
- Visualized clusters for better understanding  
- Extracted actionable insights for **targeted marketing**  

## Tech Stack
- **Python**  
- **scikit-learn** (KMeans)  
- **pandas**, **numpy** for data handling  
- **matplotlib**, **seaborn** for visualization  

## Key Learnings
- How clustering works without labeled data  
- Choosing `k` effectively using Elbow method  
- Translating raw clusters into meaningful business segments
